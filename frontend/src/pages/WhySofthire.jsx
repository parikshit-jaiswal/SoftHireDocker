        Why We Built SoftHire: Making International Recruitment Easy, Compliant, and Affordable
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Hiring the right person is hard. Hiring the right person from overseas? Even harder.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        From sponsor license applications to immigration compliance, most businesses — especially mid-sized ones — find themselves tangled in red tape. The rules are complex, the processes manual, and the risks of getting it wrong are high. Meanwhile, companies are missing out on top-tier global talent simply because the system isn’t built to support them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        That’s why we created <strong>SoftHire</strong> — a smarter, AI-enabled recruitment platform built to simplify international hiring from end to end.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Whether you're applying for a UK sponsor license, staying compliant with sponsor duties, or searching for pre-vetted international candidates, SoftHire brings everything under one powerful, intuitive system.
      </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🧩 The Problem We Set Out to Solve</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The UK’s economic growth is hampered by skills shortages. More than a third of all employers in the UK say they can’t find the skilled talent they need.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Meanwhile, the immigration system is a challenge to navigate — and finding the right talent abroad is an even bigger challenge.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When we spoke to growing companies, we kept hearing the same frustrations:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>“We don’t know how to sponsor a visa.”</li>
          <li>“The process feels overwhelming and expensive.”</li>
          <li>“We can’t afford to make a compliance mistake.”</li>
          <li>“We found great international candidates, but we don’t know how to hire them legally.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Recruitment platforms weren’t equipped to help with sponsorship. Immigration lawyers were essential but costly. And sponsor license holders are lacking the tools to manage their obligations confidently.
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw a clear need: a single platform that makes it easy, affordable, and legally compliant to tap into global talent.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🔍 Why SoftHire Is Different</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What makes us unique isn’t just our technology. It’s the seamless integration of legal compliance and recruitment into one intelligent platform.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most providers handle bits and pieces — some help you with visas, others with hiring, others with audits. SoftHire handles it all, holistically and transparently.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we’re built for accessibility. You don’t need an in-house legal team or a big HR budget to hire internationally. We make sure startups and SMEs can compete like enterprises — and we integrate with your existing systems for a smooth experience.
